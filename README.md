# METU-Bioinformatics Repository

This repository contains my assignments for two bioinformatics courses at METU:

## BIN506: Protein and DNA-Seq Analysis
The **BIN506** course focuses on analyzing protein and DNA sequences. Key tools used include:
- **BLAST**, **BLAST-X**, and **MEME Suite** for sequence alignment and analysis.
- Various online tools for manipulating and ascribing information to sequence files.
- The course covers searching, analyzing, and interpreting sequence data.

## BIN508: Next-Generation Sequencing and Informatics
The **BIN508** course explores the tools and techniques used in next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The course emphasizes:
- **Galaxy**, and **Terminal** for running bioinformatics workflows.
- Concepts like **quality control**, **plasticity**, **self-power**, and **multiplicity** in sequence data.
- The use of various tools and platforms for NGS data analysis, including working with different data types and pipelines.

This repository houses the assignments and projects completed for these two courses, showcasing my understanding of protein/DNA sequence analysis, as well as next-generation sequencing tools and techniques.
