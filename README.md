# METU-Bioinformatics Repository

This repository contains my assignments for bioinformatics courses at METU:

## BIN506: Protein and DNA-Seq Analysis
The **BIN506** course covers the methods of DNA and protein sequence analysis in depth including analysis of homology, identification of motifs and domains, pair-wise and multiple alignments, and statistical significance of sequence alignments. The course will also cover sequence and motif databases such as GeneBank, SwissProt, Protiste, and Pfam.
Key tools used:
- **BLAST/BLAT**, **T-COFFEE**, **CLUSTAL-O**, **MEME Suite** , **EMBOSS Needle / Water**, and **Dot-Matrix** "for sequence alignment and analysis.
- The course covers searching, analyzing, and interpreting sequence data.

## BIN508: Next-Generation Sequencing and Informatics
The **BIN508** course provides an introduction to methods for next-generation nucleic acid sequencing (NGS) data analysis. It includes most recent high-thoughput sequencing laboratory technologies and informatics tools for data analyses. It also covers Data structures and algorithms for the NGS technologies and applications including ***variant detection, CHIP-seq, RNA-seq, de novo assembly, and targeted sequencing** . Computational frameworks and toolkits such as **SAMTools**, **BedTools***, **BWA**, **TopHat/Cufflinks**, **GATK**, **QIIME**, **R**, and **Galaxy** are used. 
- **Galaxy**, and **Terminal** for running bioinformatics workflows.
- The use of various tools and platforms for NGS data analysis, including working with different data types and pipelines.

This repository houses the assignments and projects completed for these two courses, showcasing my understanding of protein/DNA sequence analysis, as well as next-generation sequencing tools and techniques.
