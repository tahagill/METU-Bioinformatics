- For part 1, on IGV, the reference genome you should select should be
  mm39, since it is the version you download using the link.

- For 1c, you need to use the SAM file, not the BAM file. Galaxy creates
  a bit of confusion here as it stores these alignment files only as the
  BAM version, but converts it to SAM version if the user needs it. But
  this process is completely hidden from the user.
  - You should use the 'more' command on the SAM file to see the contents.
    As you tap on the space bar, you will be able to scroll down.

- You results might differ from the Galaxy tutorial. 

- For part 2, using Galaxy is HIGHLY SUGGESTED. 
  - If you are comfortable with terminal,
    - and if you have a PC/Mac with good specs, 
      feel free to try terminal commands.
